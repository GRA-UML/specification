defaults which realize elements: ignore as defaults (change query from getInstanceValues to getDefaultInstanceValues

missing iepd name.  adjusted path construction

schemaLocation.  adjusted fixup for schemaLocation to be a different location, as suggested in issue.  However,
	that schema location produces validation errors.  The capitalization of schema names was changed, and
	not clear if schemas at that location are really valid.

operation exceptions:  include raisedException hooks for Operation/Reception;  Need to identify model/interface/operation which has problem

prefixes:  add default prefixes for niem namespaces

2 iepds - ?

missing provider and consumer for realWorldEffects:  changed context, need unique instance for each container

(Missing ServiceInteraction elements).  Actual problem: ServiceDescription Instance realizes CollaborationUse, should realize Collaboration. 
No apparent need for CollaborationUse.

missing serviceProvider:  actual problem:= "Participant" instance of serviceProvider link (non-containment) from Service is not contained in model.

Non-conformant file-paths:  Note that the OMG syntax for models is not in general produciible from actual tools, nor is it necessarily readable from tools.
The example files are not normative.  If a normative set of example files is required, it could be produced but would be unusable by any tool.

symptom: ObjectType is not applicable to Class, leading to lots of errors including missing types in target schemas.
Work-around:  make ObjectType explicitly extend Class in Profile
